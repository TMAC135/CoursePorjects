Note:
There are mainly 4 scripts for this task. 
-MyCalendar.html
-CalendarInput.html
-AdRotator.css
-AdRotator.js

image1,image2,image3 are three images I cite from the web.

For the tool kit part requirements, since there are no details for this, I use div to show the information when 
we hover around, and since there is no requirement for html and css validator, I am not testing it for this. 

The codes may not be very concise since I finish this assignment gradually.
