For this programming assignment, there are mainly 2 running scripts
-roberts.m
-sobel.m
which correspond to edge detection operators, the main contend of these two scripts are 
the same except for the kernel matrix. The structure of two scripts are formed of two parts:
part 1 is for step 1 and step 2 in the assignment, part 2 is for step 3.

There are other instrumental function scripts for this assignment which are written by me:
-conv2() => compute the convolution of two matrix, which perform the same functionality as build-in function conv2() 
-neighbor_count() => count number of 255â€™s for a given element in a matrix, using 8 connectivity
-expension() => fill in the gap for the magnitude from part 1
-thining() => do edge thinning after expansion matrix, we use eight connectivity and have 4 passes for the original matrix
