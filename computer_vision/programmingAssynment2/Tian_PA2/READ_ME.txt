There are two main scripts for this assignment:
—- Line_Detect.m
—- Ellipse_Detect.m
and some self-written functions:
—- conv2_byme.m
—- sobel_edge.m
—- findEdge.m
—- plot_result_lines.m
—- plot_result_ellipses.m

To run the code, just run two main scripts and will get the results and figure.
Notice there will be about 5~10 minutes to run the section 1 part of Ellipse_Detect.m, if
you don’t want to spend time waiting for the result, you can skip this section and run section 2 directly since I have saved the ‘my_running_hough_matrix.mat’ and load it in the beginning of section 2.

See detailed steps in Report.
